<p>The below gives a very succinct overview of some main issues to
robotics&mdash;but be forewarned that it mainly deals with robotic arms (or,
arguably, other limbs).</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<h2 id="traditional-robot-arms">Traditional robot arms</h2>
<p>A large part of traditional robotics can be described as transformations
of manifolds. For instance, a pick-and-place operation can be formulated
as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pixel image <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is transformed to Cartesian coordinates
    <span class="math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> indicating, e.g., the centre of mass of the known object;</li>
<li>The target position <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol p_d=(x,y,z)\)</span> is transformed to a set of
    joint angles <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol q_d\)</span> that describe the joint angles the robot
    should take so that its end-effector reach the position <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol p_d\)</span>;</li>
<li>The desired joint angles <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol q_d\)</span> is transformed to a sequence of
    joint angles
    <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol q_0, \boldsymbol q_0 + \Delta\boldsymbol q, \boldsymbol q_0 + 2\Delta\boldsymbol q, \dots, \boldsymbol q_d\)</span>,
    describing a trajectory in joint space;</li>
<li><a name="dynamics"></a><span class="math">\(\Delta\boldsymbol q\)</span> is transformed to joint torques <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol\tau\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\boldsymbol\tau\)</span> is transformed to motor currents <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol i\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each and every one of the abovementioned transformations is defined by a
<em>model</em>. For instance, in the first transformation this is an
environment model, in which the target object is known (and thus can be
recognised through an algorithm), while the camera parameters are also
known (or <em>calibrated</em>, and thus the pixel image can be transformed to a
coordinate in Cartesian space). In the second transformation, Cartesian
space can be transformed to joint space through inverse kinematics,
requiring detailed knowledge of the robot system, while at the same time
possibly solving underdeterminedness of the system.</p>
<p>The use of such models is both advantageous and a problem. When the
models are highly accurate&mdash;e.g., the forwards and cq. inverse
kinematics of a robot arm&mdash;as well as stable, and can be easily
obtained, their use to linearise the transformations is efficient. But
in some cases this is not easily done. Already the first transformation
in the above example demonstrates this: it limits the system to work in
predefined environments only, <em>and</em> restricts its use to simple, highly
dependable and calibrated sensors. When, e.g., cameras are not
calibrated, or soft tactile sensors are used, models do not suffice or
are unavailable, and machine-learning methods are needed. Or, increase
the complexity of the task and models are insufficient. This happens,
for instance, when the goal cannot be simply described</p>
<p>Similarly problematic is the case there the dynamics of the robot is no
longer simply computed (<a href="#dynamics">step above</a>). And this is where industrial and
modern robotics diverge. The dynamics of an industrial robot can be
simplified by assuming independence of each of its joints. That is, the
movement of joint <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is assumed to have no influence on that of joints
<span class="math">\(i-1\)</span> nor <span class="math">\(i+1\)</span>&mdash;or any of the other joints for that matter. By
building the robot's (direct-drive or low gear ratio) motors strong
enough so that this assumption holds, and making its beams (links)
strong and non-bending, this approach works well. But the resulting
robot is so strong, that interaction with humans is too dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="light-weight-robots">Light-weight robots</h2>
<p>To solve this, light-weight robots increased in popularity in the 1990s.
The principle of such a robot is simple: apart from a light structure,
the light-weight robot is defined by small, high-revolute motors which
can only create useful torques through high-ratio gears (e.g., 1:100;
typically a harmonic gear). The whole structure can be built at rather
low weights&mdash;a reduction by an order of magnitude is possible while
reaching the same torques&mdash;but introduces some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nonlinearity of the gears are hard to model, thus leading to
    inaccuracies;</li>
<li>The high gear ratio introduces backlash;</li>
<li>The reduced strength of the beams introduces undesired
    flexibilities;</li>
<li><a name="speed"></a>The high
    gear ratio reduces the maximal speed and acceleration of the joints.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though models, in combination with feedback control, can still be
constructed to solve the former of the above problems, still it requires
very accurate robot production methods&mdash;in particular for the
gear&mdash;thus increasing the cost of the robot. This was observed in,
e.g., the KUKA LWR, which was about an order of magnitude more expensive
than its "stiff" counterparts.</p>
<!-- ![The DLR LBR-III, from which the KUKA LWR-4 was produced.]({filename}/images/robotics/arms.jpg) -->

<!-- {% img image fit {filename}/images/robotics/arms.jpg %} -->

<!-- ![Lightweight robots (left to right): Barrett arm, DLR Lightweight Robot III, KUKA LBR iiwa, FRANKA EMIKA; passively flexible anthropomorphic robots left to right: COmpliant HuMANoid Platform (CO-MAN) from IIT, Valkyrie from NASA, and Hand Arm SYstem (HASY) from DLR.]({filename}/images/robotics/lwrs.png) -->

<p>The second problem is harder to counteract. In a harmonic gear this is
rather a matter of back drive: a small movement at the motor side has no
measurable effect at the link side. The DLR LWR-III, later sold as KUKA
LWR-4 and KUKA iiwa, solves this elegantly by including joint torque
sensors at the link side. This has the advantage that the joints can be
used as sensors, since models of joint and gears allows measuring
differences between expected and the measured torques, thus enabling
relatively accurate measurement of outside impacts. The sensors, of
course, increase costs, but the system now can be used for impedance
control. This control strategy, inspired by biological behaviour, is
important for interaction of robots with the environment. Rather than
defining the position of the joint, it defines its <em>position and
stiffness</em>. The latter can be seen as a force field or spring around the
position; the characteristics of these springs can be defined by
control.</p>
<p>From March 2009 the KUKA LBR 4 has been used in the fully automated
assembly of rear axle gearboxes at the Mercedes-Benz Untertürkheim
plant, assembling hundreds of thousands of gear boxes. Its "sensitivity"
allow it to be used in assembly operations, quite comparable to how
humans would do it.</p>
<p>But it also introduces a problem: apart from the joint position, a robot
movement now also needs to define a joint <em>stiffness</em> along its
trajectory. How is this best chosen? Two approaches are possible: (1) by
trying to observe humans using their stiffness variation, or (2) by
optimal control.</p>
<p>The former of these approaches is problematic: not only is measuring
stiffness in human behaviour very hard, esp. during movement; but also,
the range of stiffness that humans can attain and at what cost differs
dramatically from robots. A transfer of strategies may lead to high
inefficiency.</p>
<p>Optimal-control strategies suffer from two other problems. First,
traditional optimal control is non-tractable in the general case; that
currently already occurs with robots with 2 degrees of freedom. Second,
it is not always clear which cost function an optimal-control algorithm
should optimise.</p>
<p>Finally, problem <a href="#speed">above</a> is serious, as it limits the efficiency
of a robot. If a robot moves or reacts slower than a human, it is no
longer "fun" to work with it. Waiting for a machine is frustrating, and
leads to reduced acceptability of such.</p>
<h2 id="variable-impedance-robots">Variable-impedance robots</h2>
<p>Working with the impedance-control subject shortly explained in the
previous section, each position of the robot&mdash;be it in Cartesian or
joint space&mdash;can be seen as having an additional mechanical spring
connected to it. The robot can be moved away from a position through an
external influence, and the force needed to do so is linearly related to
how far that deflection is.</p>
<p>But the spring is only defined by control. It is not a <em>real</em> spring,
and therefore cannot store energy. Looking again into biology, there's
something to be said to use real springs. Not only could these be used
to absorb energy in the case of an impact, but also could that stored
energy be used to generate large torques and thus very swift
movements&mdash;the kangaroo-effect, so to say.</p>
<p>Variable-stiffness cq. variable-impedance robots implement this in
hardware, by adding additional springs to each actuators. In order to be
variable, the spring constants of these must be changeable. Furthermore,
since springs are physically finite, they must be nonlinear. Finally, of
course springs add oscillations, so the control of the joints need to
take damping into account&mdash;in fact, not different from the robots in
the previous section.</p>
<!-- ![Possible implementation of a nonlinear spring, as needed in a variable-impedance robot. The stiffness is linearly related to $l/h$.]({filename}/images/robotics/stiffness-setup.jpg) -->

<p><img class="image left" src="https://argmax.ai/images/robotics/stiffness-setup.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possible implementation of a nonlinear spring, as needed in a variable-impedance robot. The stiffness is linearly related to <span class="math">\(l / h\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such robots not being universally available for commercial applications,
they do have their merits, solving most if not all of the problems
mentioned above. But of course, some problems are also introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanical construction is difficult, and currently not ripe;</li>
<li>Each joint now has 3 control parameters: position, stiffness, and
    damping, thus making optimal control more complex;</li>
<li>Models of the joints are very difficult to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<p>To our current knowledge, the above problems can only be used via modern
machine-learning approaches.</p>
<h2 id="human-robot-interaction">Human-robot interaction</h2>
<p>Both the abovementioned light-weight robots and the variable-impedance
robots are, in principle, suitable for human&ndash;robot interaction. Neither
system is strong enough for serious peril&mdash;e.g., the DLR LWR-III was
measured at a HIC of around 25. That makes the robot good to interact
with humans. But can the human interact with the robot? To do so, the
robot must be an acceptable proxy for another human. This requires
various levels of interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>the robot should match human movement agility&mdash;possible, perhaps,
    for the variable-impedance robots mentioned above;</li>
<li>the robot should predict human movement, to interact;</li>
<li>the robot should recognise human movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are easily possible without modern machine-learning
approaches.</p>
